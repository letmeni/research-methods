# Tutorials - Research Methods for Political Science B (2020)

Hello! In this github page you will find the tutorial slides and some additional materials on topics covered on tutorials from PO3110, [Research Methods for Political Science B](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/undergraduate/module-outlines/js/research-methods-b/index1920.php). The core material from the module, such as lecture slides, homeworks and datasets can be found on [Blackboard](http://tcd.ie/blackboard). 

#### Office Hours

It is always better to address doubts you may have during our tutorials, as it may help some of your classmates as well. In any case, I am available to meet upon request, preferrably on Tuesdays (11 to 12). You can reach me through my email: leticia.barbabela@ucdconnect.ie

#### Get and install SPSS

The statistical sofware used in this course is SPSS. As a TCD student, you get a free SPSS license from the [IT Service](https://www.tcd.ie/itservices/help/it-service-desk-contact.php). 

What you need to do: 

- Either you go to the IT Service Desk, get an installation DVD and fill out a form, or you print the [form](https://www.tcd.ie/itservices/assets/doc/purchase_local/SPSS-Form.pdf), bring it to the IT Service Desk and download SPSS directly from the [TCD download website](https://software.tcd.ie). 
- Note that you will need to be logged in to the TCD network (cabled) to download the software. Once you got the files, follow the instructions provided in the PDF file. 
- The licence code is on the tcd software website, [HERE](https://www.tcd.ie/itservices/local/spss_licence.php).
- If you scroll down on the licence page there should be an heading for the 2018/19 licence.
- You are free to use alternative (and free) statistical software such as [R](https://www.r-project.org) or [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org). 


### Online Support and Resources

[Andrea Salvi] (https://github.com/AndrSalvi/research-methods.php) has organized a collection of useful links to help you develop you software skills in addition to our tutorials:

#### SPSS

- [SPSS Tutorials](https://www.spss-tutorials.com): A website with dozens of useful SPSS tutorials.
- [Tutorials, Kent State University](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/home): An wide range of written and illustrated  SPSS tutorials.

#### R

- [UCLA Tutorials for R, Stata and SAS](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/dae/): Very useful tutorials for the most important statistical analyses.
- [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com): Simulates an R workspace allowing you to learn R in R.
- [Moderndive](http://www.moderndive.com): A great interactive introduction to data visualisation and modelling in R.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): Here you will find almost all answers to specific questions.

## Information on submitting assignments

Throughout this term you will need to submit homeworks, assignments and a research project. You are free to conduct the homework with SPSS or an alternative statistical software (for example Stata or R, but _not_ Excel).

Some general rules:
1. The assignments must be typed into a LaTeX or Word/Open Office document and submitted as a PDF via Turnitin (see the Syllabus for more details). Screenshots of the SPSS output are _not_ sufficient as you will need to describe and interpret the results and procedures.

2. If you include tables, do not use a screenshot, but use the **"export"** function from SPSS. Please save figures appropriately in [high resolution](https://thepoliticalmethodologist.com/2013/11/25/making-high-resolution-graphics-for-academic-publishing/) (We recommend PDF as vector graphic formats have the best possible quality).

3. Add the contents of the SPSS Syntax file/R script/Stata do file at the end of your document. It is good academic practice to present the full code and replication script. While SPSS has a point-and-klick interface, not relying on scripts results in extra work if you need to repeat an analysis. Even more important, only with scripts you can ensure reproducibility of your results. On the topic of reproducibility, have a look at the following links:
- [AJPS guidelines for preparing replication files](https://ajpsblogging.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ajps-replic-guidelines-ver-2-1.pdf)
- [Reproducible research using the SPSS syntax option](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/Syntax)
- [SPSS online video tutorials](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/Software-tutorials/SPSS-tutorials)

To reiterate, **please copy the contents from the SPSS syntax file at the end of the submitted document**.

## Useful links for each tutorial
